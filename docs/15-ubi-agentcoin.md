# Universal Basic Income on TON Blockchain

## Abstract

This document outlines the design for implementing Universal Basic Income (UBI) on the TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain. The system creates a global UBI distribution mechanism that bridges economic gaps between developed and developing countries through decentralized compute participation and human verification.

## UBI Implementation on TON

### Core Innovation
**Global UBI Distribution**: A blockchain-based universal income system that provides equal monthly payments to verified humans worldwide, with potential to bridge economic gaps between countries. For example, a 500 USD monthly UBI payment represents a modest bonus in Canada (covering ~20% of rent) while constituting an average monthly salary in India.

### TON Blockchain Advantages
- **High Scalability**: Block graph architecture with cells enables massive transaction throughput
- **Native Features**: Built-in token staking, sharded execution, and integrated storage
- **Telegram Integration**: Potential for seamless user onboarding through existing Telegram ecosystem
- **Low Transaction Costs**: Efficient consensus mechanism reduces UBI distribution overhead

## UBI Distribution Mechanism

### Economic Model
The UBI system operates through a dual-contribution model that rewards both computational participation and human verification:

**Compute Contribution Rewards**: Participants who provide computational resources for network tasks (inference, training, validation) earn proportional shares of the UBI pool.

**Human Participation Requirements**: Verified humans earn UBI through minimal participation activities designed to be accessible across all device types and economic situations.

**Global Impact**: The system has potential to reduce global economic inequality by providing universal access to basic income regardless of geographic location or economic development level.

## UBI Token Distribution

### Distribution Formula
The UBI system implements a 50/50 allocation model designed to balance computational contributions with human accessibility:

**Fifty Percent to Compute Providers**: Distributed proportionally among all nodes that contributed computational resources to network operations, weighted by the value and efficiency of their contributions.

**Fifty Percent to Verified Humans**: Split equally among all verified human participants who demonstrated any level of network engagement, regardless of their computational capacity.

### Participation Requirements
**Minimal Engagement Threshold**: Humans maintain UBI eligibility through light computational tasks accessible on any device including smartphones, tablets, laptops, smart watches, or IoT devices.

**Battery-Friendly Operations**: All human participation tasks are designed to consume minimal power and computational resources, ensuring accessibility across economic conditions and device capabilities.

## TON Blockchain Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture
The UBI distribution system operates through TON smart contracts that automate monthly payments and human verification processes:

**UBI Distribution Contract**: Manages monthly token allocation, tracks participant eligibility, and executes automatic payments based on verification status and contribution metrics.

**Human Verification Contract**: Integrates with government-issued digital identity systems to verify human participants while preserving privacy through cryptographic proofs.

**Compute Contribution Tracker**: Records and validates computational contributions from network participants, calculating proportional reward distributions.

### TON-Specific Advantages
**Cell-Based Storage**: TON's unique cell architecture enables efficient storage of participant data, verification records, and contribution histories without traditional blockchain bloat.

**Workchain Scalability**: Different UBI operations can be distributed across specialized workchains, enabling parallel processing of verifications, distributions, and contributions.

**Integrated File Storage**: TON Storage provides decentralized storage for verification documents and participation records without requiring external storage solutions.

## Human Verification System

### Government-Issued Digital Identity
The primary verification method utilizes public-private key pairs issued by trusted government or municipal authorities, creating secure human verification without traditional CAPTCHA limitations.

### TON Integration Advantages
**Telegram Ecosystem**: Leverages existing Telegram user base and government partnerships for streamlined identity verification processes.

**Consensus Governance**: TON's governance model enables network-wide consensus on trusted identity providers per jurisdiction, similar to Ethereum's governance mechanisms.

**Privacy-First Design**: Users can link government-issued verification keys to specific wallet addresses while maintaining privacy across other financial activities.

### Alternative Approaches
**Independent Verification Services**: Integration with WorldCoin, Telegram verification, or similar platforms provides alternative pathways, though with increased risk of Sybil attacks and duplicate identities.

## UBI Funding Mechanism

### Token Economics
The UBI system operates through network transaction fees and computational task revenues that fund monthly distributions:

**Network Transaction Tax**: Small percentage of all TON network transactions contributes to the UBI pool, creating sustainable funding through network growth.

**Computational Task Revenue**: Fees from AI inference, training, and other computational tasks provide additional funding sources for UBI distribution.

### Sustainability Model
**Self-Sustaining Economy**: As network usage grows, transaction volume increases UBI pool funding, enabling larger monthly payments or expanded participant base.

**Global Economic Impact**: Regular UBI payments create economic stimulus effects, particularly in developing countries where payments represent significant purchasing power.

## Virtual Machine and Agent Execution

### Containerized Execution Environment
The system may support lightweight virtualized environments similar to Docker or Firecracker, enabling customizable task execution while maintaining security boundaries.

### Safety Considerations
Sandboxing becomes crucial for secure agent execution, requiring robust isolation mechanisms to prevent malicious behavior while enabling flexible task performance.

## TON Blockchain Integration

### Technical Advantages
The Telegram Open Network (TON) offers superior scalability compared to traditional blockchain implementations through its block graph architecture using cells rather than linear chains.

### Native Feature Support
TON provides built-in functionality essential for federated learning operations:

**Token Staking Infrastructure**: Native staking mechanisms for economic incentives and penalty enforcement.

**Sharded Execution**: Distributed processing capabilities supporting parallel task execution.

**Smart Contract Platform**: Programmable logic for automated task assignment and reward distribution.

**Integrated File Storage**: TON Storage provides decentralized file systems for model and data distribution.

## Model Storage Optimization

### Efficiency Strategies
Large model storage requires optimization to enable participation from lower-power nodes while maintaining network accessibility.

### Storage Reduction Approaches

**Model Compression**: Advanced compression algorithms reduce storage requirements without significant performance degradation.

**Quantization Implementation**: Lower precision representations enable lighter clients to participate in fine-tuning and inference tasks.

**Hash-Based Storage**: On-chain hash storage with off-chain weight distribution, enabling chunk-based participation for resource-constrained devices.

**Differential Storage**: Dropout regularization combined with storing only weight changes reduces storage overhead for incremental updates.

### Model Distribution Strategy
The system supports chunked model distribution, allowing lighter clients to participate without downloading complete model weights, democratizing access to large language model capabilities.

## Use Cases and Applications

### Enterprise Integration
Large companies can leverage the system for content verification, providing labels for content authenticity, AI generation detection, and quality assessment. This enables AI laboratories to exclude specific content from training sets while allowing content owners to cross-reference trusted party assessments.

### Real-Time Data Integration
Initial integration with services like Apify.com provides scraped real-time internet data to the blockchain, with future development of custom parsing services running directly on smart contracts through AI agents equipped with browser automation tools.

### Network Infrastructure
Currency-tied network traffic enables mesh networking capabilities, allowing devices to access internet connectivity through peer devices, particularly valuable for brain-computer interface applications requiring reliable connectivity.
