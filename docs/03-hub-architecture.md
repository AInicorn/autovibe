# Hub Architecture - The Orchestrator Machine

## Hub as Intelligent Machine

The Hub is itself an Intelligent Machine that manages other Intelligent Machines. It follows the same lifecycle patterns but with specialized orchestration capabilities.

## Hub VM Structure

### VM Configuration
- **Type**: Standard VM (not container for MVP)
- **Resources**: 4+ cores, 8+ GB RAM, 50+ GB disk
- **Network**: API access + Proxmox management interface access
- **Permissions**: Can spawn/terminate other VMs via Proxmox API

### Internal Stack (Docker Compose)
The Hub runs a multi-service architecture within its VM:

- **Orchestrator Service**: Main Python application handling API requests, machine spawning, and budget management
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Stores project data, checkpoint metadata, and resource tracking information
- **Redis Cache**: Manages session state, caching, and job queues for performance
- **Nginx Proxy**: Provides reverse proxy, SSL termination, and rate limiting capabilities

## Hub Checkpointing System

### Infrastructure-Level Checkpointing
Unlike task machines that checkpoint application state (post-MVP), Hub checkpoints its **entire VM**:

1. **Mark in Database**: Update checkpoint UUID in PostgreSQL
2. **Trigger Snapshot**: Call Proxmox API to create ZFS/PBS snapshot of entire VM
3. **Verify Completion**: Confirm snapshot creation and update database status

### Checkpoint Frequency
- **Production**: Daily automated checkpoints (00:00 UTC)
- **Development**: Manual checkpoints only (auto-checkpointing disabled)
- **Before Major Operations**: Manual checkpoint before spawning experimental Hubs
- **Emergency**: On-demand checkpoints before risky system changes

### Technical Implementation Process
Hub checkpointing follows a three-step process using ORM operations:

1. **Database Marking**: Generate unique checkpoint UUID and create database record with "creating" status
2. **Snapshot Trigger**: Call Proxmox API to create ZFS/PBS snapshot of the entire Hub VM using the checkpoint UUID
3. **Status Update**: Update database record to "completed" status once snapshot creation is verified

## Multi-Hub Evolution System

### Hub Spawning Strategy
When current Hub shows signs of local optima or performance issues:

1. **Identify Stagnation**: Metrics show declining efficiency, budget waste, or poor machine selection
2. **Select Evolutionary Checkpoint**: Choose checkpoint from ~2 weeks ago as evolutionary base
3. **Define Experimental Parameters**: Different objectives, algorithms, or configurations
4. **Spawn Experimental Hub**: Create new Hub VM from selected checkpoint
5. **Parallel Operation**: Run both Hubs in isolated environments for evaluation period

### Hub Selection Process
After 14-day experimental period:

1. **Performance Comparison**: Compare resource efficiency, project completion rates, budget utilization
2. **A/B Test Results**: Analyze which Hub produces better outcomes
3. **Selection Decision**: Choose superior Hub, terminate inferior one
4. **State Migration**: If experimental Hub wins, migrate active projects and continue evolution

### Hub Types and Specialization

#### Production Hub
- **Focus**: Stability, proven algorithms, conservative resource allocation
- **Checkpointing**: Daily automated snapshots
- **Risk Tolerance**: Low - prioritizes reliability over optimization

#### Development Hub  
- **Focus**: Experimental features, algorithm testing, new machine types
- **Checkpointing**: Manual only - frequent iterations without snapshot overhead
- **Risk Tolerance**: High - allows failure for learning

#### Domain-Specific Hubs
- **Client Hubs**: Dedicated to specific clients with custom configurations
- **Project Hubs**: Specialized for particular project types (web dev, ML, DevOps)
- **Geographic Hubs**: Located in different regions for latency optimization

## Hub Recovery and Rollback

### Self-Recovery Mechanisms
Hubs can detect and recover from failures:

1. **Health Monitoring**: Continuous self-assessment of system health
2. **Automatic Rollback**: If critical failure detected, rollback to previous checkpoint
3. **Progressive Recovery**: Try recent checkpoints first, fall back to older ones if needed
4. **Alert Generation**: Notify administrators of recovery events

### Recovery Decision Logic
Hub recovery follows a progressive fallback strategy:

1. **Recent Checkpoint Recovery**: When critical failure is detected, attempt rollback to the last 3 checkpoints sequentially
2. **Progressive Fallback**: If recent checkpoints fail, attempt rollback to stable checkpoint from 1 week ago
3. **Deep Recovery**: For severe failures, fall back to older stable checkpoints with administrator notification
4. **Recovery Logging**: All recovery events are logged with success/failure status and checkpoint UUIDs for debugging

## Proxmox Integration

### Required Proxmox Permissions
Hub VM needs specific permissions to manage other VMs:
- **VM Creation**: Spawn new VMs from templates
- **VM Control**: Start, stop, restart operations  
- **Snapshot Management**: Create, list, delete VM snapshots
- **Resource Monitoring**: Check VM resource utilization
- **Template Access**: Clone from pre-configured machine templates

### API Integration Points
- **VM Lifecycle**: Create → Configure → Start → Monitor → Stop → Snapshot → Destroy
- **Resource Quotas**: Enforce budget limits through VM resource constraints
- **Snapshot Orchestration**: Coordinate checkpoint creation across multiple VMs
- **Health Monitoring**: Track VM performance and availability

## Hub Security Model

### Isolation Principles
- **Network Segmentation**: Hub VM in management VLAN, task VMs in isolated networks
- **API Authentication**: All Proxmox API calls authenticated and logged
- **Resource Limits**: Hub cannot exceed allocated resource quotas
- **Audit Trail**: All Hub actions logged for security and debugging

### Permission Granularity
- **VM Management**: Can create/destroy VMs within allocated resource pools
- **Snapshot Control**: Can trigger snapshots but not directly access snapshot storage
- **Database Access**: Full control over autovibe database, read-only system tables
- **Network Access**: API endpoints only, no direct internet access for task VMs

This Hub architecture creates a self-managing, self-evolving orchestration system that maintains the same Intelligent Machine principles while providing sophisticated infrastructure management capabilities.
